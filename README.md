cryptoExchange is a complete mobile app that allows you to consult the evolution (market price) of a certain number of crypto-currencies authorized for the moment on the application, then to exchange these crypto-currencies against other physical or virtual devices.
All transactions (purchase, exchange, withdrawal) are done using MOBILE MONEY [FLOOZ](https://moov-africa.bj/), [MTN MOMO](https://www.mtn.bj/momo/developpeurs/momo-api/) and by credit card.<br>
Finally the app gives the possibility to check the total balance of a user in different devices.<br>
